## Hello, and Welcome!

I am the Human Genomics Team Leader at [EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) in Cambridge, UK. In this role, I lead multiple teams contributing to the [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) project, a foundational resource providing scientists with data and tools to study the genomes of a variety of organisms, including humans. I am also responsible for key human variation interpretation services hosted at EBI including the [DECIPHER](https://www.deciphergenomics.org/) platform and the [Gene2Phenotype](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype) system.

Previously, I was Coordinator for the [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/) (EGA), a controlled access resource for managing sensitive human omics data. I was responsible for delivery of EGA services and coordinating projects with our collaborators to support our strategic goals. Prior to this, I was the EGA Project Lead for coordinating archive and distribution of nearly 20PB of whole genome sequencing data from the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) resource. I joined EMBL-EBI in 2017 as part of the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA) Data Coordination Platform](https://data.humancellatlas.org/) team, where I developed the [HCA metadata standard](https://data.humancellatlas.org/metadata) and worked closely with data generators to submit the first single cell sequencing datasets to the HCA.

### How did I get here :question:

After completing my BSc degree in Bioinformatics at Saint Vincent College, I earned my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan studying post-transcriptional gene regulation in the model organisms _C. elegans_ (nematode) and _S. cerevisiae_ (budding yeast). I studied mechanisms of mRNA regulation and expression of small, functional RNAs including microRNAs and germline-specific piRNAs. I also studied protein-RNA interactions and how they contribute to post-transcriptional gene regulation. If interested, you can read more in [my public thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111339). 

I then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University, continuing my exploration of protein-RNA interactions through re-analysis of published deep sequencing data. I also piloted experiments directly sequencing full-length messenger RNAs in nematodes using Oxford Nanopore sequencing to explore the diversity of the nematode transcriptome. 

During my postdoc, two key things happened that shaped the trajectory of my career. First, I gained an appreciation for the challenges facing researchers who want to re-use published datasets. Second, I joined the [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) team to develop and deliver bioinformatics training. These led to solidifying my passion for "Science as a Service", specifically **building and maintaining scientific services and infrastructure to support all researchers across the life sciences**.

### Communities :raised_hands:

Some really cool communities that I am proud to be associated with:

#### [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/)

A policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework

#### [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/)

A mentorship and training program for people interested in applying open principles in their work and becoming Open Science ambassadors in their communities

#### [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/)

A European life sciences infrastructure organisation which brings together scientists from more than 23 countries and more than 250 research institutes to build and run services that enable researchers to access and analyse data, to improve the value and impact of life science research on public health, the environment, and the economy

#### [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/)

A collection of open bioinformatics tutorials and training resources developed and maintained by the global Galaxy community
